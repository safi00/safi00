### Hi there 👋

**safi00/safi00** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. 

Some of my experiences:

- 🗨️ Learning C++.
- 🔧 Made a black jack back-end program and a failed worlde/lingo & airport plane booking system.
- 🔧 Made 2 Unity educational game projects & Worked on a existing game together with a assigned group:

        * Stars - 3D Snake game with coins as a the collectibles and with math question prompts that gives points and a power up!
        * Atomic Center - 3D Board game based on a self made board game, where you guess elements.
        * Villa Elektra - Worked on this as a group, we cleaned it up a little and added new levels.
